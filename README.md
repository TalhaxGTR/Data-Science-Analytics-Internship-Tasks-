# Data-Science-Analytics-Internship-Tasks-
Projects completed during my Data Science &amp; Analytics Internship. Includes EDA, visualizations, and machine learning models for tasks like credit risk, churn, and insurance prediction using Python, pandas, seaborn, and scikit-learn.

## ðŸ§  Tasks Overview

1. **Iris Dataset Exploration**
   - Visualized petal/sepal relationships using scatter plots, box plots, and histograms.
   - Tools: pandas, seaborn, matplotlib

2. **Credit Risk Prediction**
   - Built classification models (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree) to predict loan default.
   - Evaluated using accuracy and confusion matrix.

3. **Customer Churn Prediction**
   - Trained models to identify customers likely to leave the bank.
   - Used label encoding and feature importance analysis.

4. **Medical Insurance Cost Prediction**
   - Built a Linear Regression model to predict charges.
   - Evaluated using MAE and RMSE.

5. **Personal Loan Acceptance Prediction**
   - Modeled customer likelihood to accept loan offers.
   - Generated actionable business insights.
